# üìä NEDC INTEGRATION STATUS
## Quick Status Dashboard

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-13 12:00
**Sweep Progress**: 108/108 combinations (complete) ‚úÖ
**Native TAES**: PRIMARY GOAL ‚Äî **CRITICAL BUG FOUND** - gives wrong metrics!

## What's Done ‚úÖ

### NEDC Binary Backend
- NEDC v6.0.0 binary integrated at `evaluation/nedc_eeg_eval/v6.0.0/`
- Full pipeline working: checkpoint ‚Üí CSV_bi ‚Üí NEDC ‚Üí metrics
- Converters and runner tested (`evaluation/nedc_scoring/`)
- Backend toggle implemented (`--backend nedc-binary|native-taes`)
- Note: If the binary errors on Python invocation, ensure a `python` alias is available on PATH (some environments only provide `python3`).

### Native TAES Backend (PRIMARY GOAL) üéØ
- Python implementation at `seizure_evaluation/taes/scorer.py` (243 lines)
- Integrated with `--backend native-taes` flag
- **BUG FOUND & UNDERSTOOD**: Not a scorer bug - a metrics extraction bug!
  - Native implements OVERLAP scoring: FA=9.97/24h @ 23.45% sensitivity ‚úÖ
  - Temple OVERLAP section: FA=9.97/24h @ 23.45% sensitivity ‚úÖ
  - **PERFECT MATCH when using overlap_threshold=0.0**
  - Issue: metrics.json extracts DP ALIGNMENT (27.72%) not OVERLAP (23.45%)
- **Next**: Decide which scoring method to use (OVERLAP vs DP ALIGNMENT)

### Parameter Tuning Progress
- Dev checkpoint: `experiments/dev/baseline/checkpoint.pkl` (~1.5GB)
- Parameter sweep: 108/108 combinations complete
- Results:
  - CSV: `experiments/dev/baseline/sweeps/sweep_results.csv`
  - Recommended: `experiments/dev/baseline/sweeps/recommended_params.json` (threshold=0.95, kernel=5, min_duration=2.0s, merge_gap=5.0s)
  - Dev TAES (Temple binary): sensitivity=13.67%, FA/24h=9.97

## How to Monitor üèÉ

```bash
# Count completed combos (folders starting with thr)
ls experiments/dev/baseline/sweeps/ | grep "^thr" | wc -l

# Tail sweep results
tail -n 20 experiments/dev/baseline/sweeps/sweep_results.csv

# Attach to tmux session if running there
tmux attach -t sweep_dev   # Ctrl+B then D to detach
```

## TWO PARALLEL TRACKS

### Track 1: Parameter Sweep (COMPLETE)
- Used Temple binary NEDC backend
- Artifacts written under `experiments/dev/baseline/sweeps/`

### Track 2: Native TAES Implementation (NEEDS WORK)
- THIS IS THE MAIN FOCUS
- Not dependent on sweep
- Can work on this NOW while sweep runs

## EVAL FINDINGS üìä

### Tuning SUCCESS with Temple Binary:
- **Baseline (no tuning)**: FA=137.5/24h @ 82% sensitivity
- **After tuning (eval)**: FA=12.41/24h @ 27.72% sensitivity
- **Improvement**: FA reduced by 91%! (137.5 ‚Üí 12.41)
- **Near target**: Only 2.41 FA/24h over our goal of 10

### Native Scorer Actually WORKS:
- Native with overlap=0.0: FA=9.97/24h @ 23.45% (matches Temple OVERLAP)
- Native with overlap=0.5: FA=23.89/24h @ 7.68% (wrong threshold)
- Temple has 4 scoring methods: DP ALIGN, OVERLAP, TAES, EPOCH
- Our metrics.json extracts DP ALIGN (27.72%) but calls it "taes"
- **Native correctly implements OVERLAP scoring!**

## CRITICAL NEXT STEPS üö®

### 1. Fix Metrics Extraction or Choose Scoring Method
```bash
# Run same data through both backends
python evaluation/nedc_scoring/run_nedc.py \
  --checkpoint experiments/dev/baseline/checkpoint.pkl \
  --backend nedc-binary --outdir test_binary

python evaluation/nedc_scoring/run_nedc.py \
  --checkpoint experiments/dev/baseline/checkpoint.pkl \
  --backend native-taes --outdir test_native

# Native scorer WORKS with overlap_threshold=0.0!
# Matches Temple OVERLAP: 23.45% sens, 9.97 FA/24h
# Issue is metrics.json extracts wrong section (DP ALIGN not OVERLAP)
# See NEDC_SCORING_BUG_ANALYSIS.md for full details
```

### 2. Finalize Operating Point Selection
No action required; recommended params are available at:
`experiments/dev/baseline/sweeps/recommended_params.json`

### 3. Select Optimal Parameters
```bash
# Find all combos with FA ‚â§ 10
for dir in experiments/dev/baseline/sweeps/thr*; do
  [ -f "$dir/results/metrics.json" ] && {
    fa=$(grep '"fa_per_24h"' "$dir/results/metrics.json" | grep -o '[0-9.]*')
    sens=$(grep '"sensitivity_percent"' "$dir/results/metrics.json" | grep -o '[0-9.]*')
    [ "$(echo "$fa <= 10" | bc -l)" = "1" ] && echo "$(basename $dir): FA=$fa, Sens=$sens%"
  }
done
```

### 4. Freeze & Deploy
```bash
# Create frozen params (example with best found)
echo '{
  "threshold": 0.90,
  "kernel": 5,
  "min_duration_sec": 8.0,
  "merge_gap_sec": 10.0
}' > experiments/eval/frozen_params.json
```

## Key Metrics Target

- MUST ACHIEVE: FA/24h ‚â§ 10
- Dev results (Temple binary): FA=9.97/24h @ 13.67% sensitivity
- **Eval results (Temple binary): FA=12.41/24h @ 27.72% sensitivity**
- Baseline without tuning: FA=137.5/24h @ 82% sensitivity
- Goal: Push sensitivity higher while keeping FA ‚â§ 10

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Run with specific params (after sweep; replace with selected values)
python evaluation/nedc_scoring/run_nedc.py \
  --checkpoint experiments/dev/baseline/checkpoint.pkl \
  --threshold <thr> --kernel <k> --min_duration_sec <min> --merge_gap_sec <gap>
```
