1 | INTRODUCTION



Summary

To increase the quality of studies on seizure detection devices, we propose stan

dards for testing and clinical validation of such devices. We identified 4 key fea

tures that are important for studies on seizure detection devices: subjects,

recordings, data analysis and alarms, and reference standard. For each of these


features, we list the specific aspects that need to be addressed in the studies, and

depending on these, studies are classified into 5 phases (0-4). We propose a set of


outcome measures that need to be reported, and we propose standards for report

ing the results. These standards will help in designing and reporting studies on

seizure detection devices, they will give readers clear information on the level of


evidence provided by the studies, and they will help regulatory bodies in assess
ing the quality of the validation studies. These standards are flexible, allowing


classification of the studies into one of the 5 phases. We propose actions that can


facilitate development of novel methods and devices.

clinical trials, mobile health, seizure detection, standards, validation studies, wearable devices



Recent advances in technology and in signal analysis have
made seizure detection a realistic goal. Several large-scale
surveys of patients and caregivers have clearly demon
strated the need for reliable automated seizure detection
using wearable devices. [1-4] Recently, there has been a considerable increase in the number of publications on seizure
detection. [5,6] However, the way studies are designed and
reported is very heterogeneous and often confusing. It can

be difficult to understand the level of evidence these stud
ies provide.
To help in designing and reporting studies on seizure
detection devices, we propose a set of standards, specific
for this field. The goal is to improve the quality of these
studies, and to provide readers a clear-cut picture of the
position of the studies in the clinical validation process.
This could be useful information for regulatory bodies
too. Developing standards for testing and validating seizure detection devices requires in-depth knowledge of the

field, because standards from trials on other types of medical devices can be difficult to extrapolate to seizure

detection.

We provide a list of key features that are essential for
studies on seizure detection, and depending on how these
aspects are addressed, classify studies into 5 categories
(phases) reminiscent of those used in therapeutic intervention clinical trials. The framework entails some flexibility
for the first 2 phases, encouraging researchers and technical
experts to engage in developing novel methods. The phase
3 pivotal trials confirming safety and accuracy are more
strictly regulated. Phase 4 denotes in-field studies of sei
zure detection devices in the home environment of the

patients, focusing on aspects related to usability (corresponding to the open-label phase of therapeutic trials).
Obviously, the level of evidence needed depends largely
on the study objectives. For seeking approval from regulatory bodies, or for devices where seizure detection is
directly connected to a therapeutic decision or intervention,
phase 3 studies should be required.

2 | KEY FEATURES OF SEIZURE
DETECTION STUDIES AND THE 5

PHASES


The essential features of studies on seizure detection

devices are grouped as follows: (1) subjects, (2) recordings,
(3) analysis and alarms, and (4) reference standard. Table 1
lists the aspects related to these features, and how the
robustness of the design can be increased. Similar to the
therapeutic trials, we suggest classifying seizure detection
trials into 5 phases. Although some aspects (like evaluation
of safety) are common for therapeutic and for diagnostic
trials, many aspects differ (pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, vs accuracy measures and device deficiency).
Therefore, there is a need to adapt these principles specifically for trials on seizure detection devices. Table 2 lists
the 5 phases (0-4) of seizure detection studies, depending
on the key features of seizure detection studies. Not all 5
phases need to be reported for all devices. A phase can be
skipped or merged with another phase. Nevertheless, it is
important to know the highest level of evidence available
for a particular device.
It is also important to define the primary goal of the
device, and the setting in which it is intended to be used
(eg, alarm caregivers to intervene, provide objective seizure
counts for treating physicians, aid in a clinical situation on
a ward or in the epilepsy monitoring unit [EMU], nocturnal
use vs whole day).
Phase 0 corresponds to initial studies on starting up or
developing a novel method. Simulated data or recordings
from normal subjects, using conventional or already

existing devices, can be included. Testing and training the
algorithm can be done on the same database (eg, using
leave-one-group-out method). There is no need for a gold

standard.

Phase 1 corresponds to proof-of-principle studies. These
are still initial studies, but they include real seizure data from
patient(s) with epilepsy; thus, a low number (1-10) of
patients with seizures is accepted at this phase and recording/
analysis of continuous data is not yet required. The same
dataset can be used for testing and training, and the analysis
is typically retrospective. There is, however, need for a reference standard for identifying seizures (including onset and

offset time point) using video-electroencephalographic
(EEG) recordings. For motor (convulsive) seizures, with
unequivocal semiology, video recordings are sufficient.

Phase 2 needs to use a dedicated seizure detection

device, on a somewhat larger number of patients with seizures (≥10), including at least 15 seizures into the analysis.
Safety of the device has to be addressed. Retrospective
analysis and using the same dataset for training and validation are still allowed at this phase. There is a strict need

for a reference standard.

Phase 3 is the final confirmation of the safety and
accuracy. It needs to address all outcome measures (see
below), and it needs a strict study design. Recordings
need to be continuous, using the dedicated seizure detection device. Analysis and seizure detection need to be
prospective and real time (ie, logging the seizure detection
time points during the recording) and use predefined algorithms, with predefined cutoff values. Training of the
algorithm on the same dataset is not allowed at this
phase. For studies on algorithms using individualized cutoff values or subject-specific training of the algorithm,
data from the baseline phase in which the algorithm or

the cutoff values are fine-tuned are not included in calcu
lation of the primary endpoint measures. These studies
need to involve patient recruitment and inclusion at several centers. Logging of the seizure detection time points
is done blinded to all other data, and experts providing
the reference standard (video or video-EEG recordings)

need to be blinded to all data from the device. The mini
mum numbers of seizures and of patients with seizures
vary depending on the intra- and interindividual variability
of the parameter used, the sensitivity expected, and the
error accepted. Therefore, a sample size calculation needs
to be specified in the study. For an expected sensitivity
of 95% and with a confidence interval of 10%, at least 20
patients with seizures have to be included. [7] To reliably
determine the false alarm rate, at least 3000 hours of con
tinuous recording from at least 30 patients is required.
Physical exercises and activities resembling the patients [0]

daily routines need to be included during the long-term
video-EEG monitoring. Home video or video-EEG monitoring is a good alternative to the EMU, provided the
whole dataset is reviewed for inferring the reference standard. Some patients need to have multiple seizures, to
determine the intraindividual consistency of seizure detections. Therefore, we propose that at least 30 seizures are
recorded in phase 3 studies.

Phase 4 consists of in-field studies of seizure detection

devices in the home environment of the patients, addressing
aspects related to usability. This is the equivalent of the
open-label phase of therapeutic trials. Patients who completed phase 3 studies can continue using the device in their
homes; thus, studies can combine phases 3 and 4 in the same



trial. The advantage of phase 4 is the potentially large number of patients, the longer recording time, and the real setting

in which the devices work. This can be at the cost of the ref
erence standard, because home video/video-EEG surveil
lance will be available only for a small group of patients, or
at least not continuously (eg, monitoring only during the
night). Reports of family members or caregivers alerted by
the alarm can be a surrogate for the absolute reference standard. Standardized questionnaires can be useful for systematically assessing the usability of the devices. Changes in the
patients’ quality of life, as well as impact of the device on
stress, anxiety, depression, seizure activity, and medical
management, can be addressed in phase 4 studies.


3 | EXAMPLES OF THE 5 PHASES
OF SEIZURE DETECTION STUDIES


We will use here examples from the development of commercially available, wearable seizure detection devices to
illustrate the 5 phases.
Using surface electromyographic (EMG) data from seizures simulated by healthy volunteers, Conradsen et al [8]

showed promising results for detecting tonic–clonic seizures (TCS). However, because EMG signals were not
recorded from real, epileptic TCS, but from simulated seizures, this study qualifies for phase 0. Subsequently, EMGbased seizure detection algorithms were tested in small
numbers (1-6) of patients, demonstrating that algorithms
can correctly identify real TCS, detected from patients with
epilepsy. [9,10] Although the number of participants was low,
using data from real epileptic seizures qualifies these studies for phase 1. [9,10] Two studies [11,12] included a larger number of patients (n = 11) with recorded TCS (22 and 21
TCS, respectively). EMG data were recorded using conventional amplifiers, data analysis was retrospective and offline, and the threshold values for triggering seizure alarms
were determined from the same dataset; sensitivity was
95%-100%. These studies [11,12] qualify for phase 2. Larger
multicenter studies (69-199 patients) used dedicated wearable devices (sEMG and accelerometer combined with
electrodermal activity, respectively). [13,14] However, data
analysis was offline (not real time) from archived data, and
the algorithm was tested retrospectively, across a wide
range (95-255) of threshold-values, [13] or optimized using
the leave-one-out method. [14] Therefore, these studies also
qualify for phase 2. [13] Another multicenter study included
71 patients, using a wearable device, and real-time seizure
detection, based on predefined threshold values, [15] thus
qualifying for phase 3. All of the above studies were conducted in EMUs, to enable comparison with an unequivocal reference standard (video-EEG). Currently, there are no
studies using EMG-based wearable devices in the home

environment of the patients. In this issue of Epilepsia,
Meritam et al [16] present such a study for an accelerometrybased wearable device that has previously been validated
in EMUs. This study qualifies for phase 4.


4 | OUTCOME MEASURES


It is of an utmost importance that studies account for the
outcome measures that are necessary to estimate the accuracy and performance of seizure detection devices:


1 Total recording time or total time when the device was
switched on. Specify also: range (minimum � maximum) and mean or median recording time per patient.
2 Device deficiency time: the proportion of the time period
when the device was not functioning. Specify the reasons for the deficiency, when possible.
3 Safety: specify all adverse effects with information on
their severity, seriousness, relation to the device, outcome, and impact on study withdrawal.
4 Sensitivity: number (and percentage) of all detected seizures/number of all seizures recorded during the study,
belonging to the seizure type the device is targeting.
Specify 95% confidence intervals. Calculate sensitivity
for each patient and specify range, mean, or median of
sensitivity per patient.
5 False alarm rate: the number of false alarms per
24 hours of recording. Specify also the number (and percentage) of patients experiencing false alarms, and the
range, mean, or median of false alarms/patient, and
describe the source of the false alarms. For patients who
had seizures, specify the ratio between the true alarms
and false alarms. If seizure types other than the one targeted by the device occurred during the recording, specify whether they were detected.
6 Detection latency: time (in seconds) from the seizure
onset of the targeted seizure type (determined by the reference standard) to the detection time. Specify range,
mean, or median. Large surveys of patients and their
caregivers showed that the required detection latency
was less than 10 seconds or 30 seconds. [2,3]


7 In-field studies should also address the experience of the
users with handling the device and the impact of the
alarms on the daily life of patients and caregivers. Standardized scales (for example 7-point Likert scale) can be
used to assess these aspects. In addition, information on
the time the device has been used and the number (and
percentage) of users who stopped the device should be
added. Kaplan-Meyer plots showing the drop in time of
patients still using the device can be useful. The reasons
why users opted to stop using the device should be

listed.



5 | REPORTING STUDIES ON
SEIZURE DETECTION DEVICES


Although seizure detection devices are typically used in
patients in whom epilepsy has already been diagnosed, they
distinguish seizure periods from nonseizure periods and thus
belong to the realm of diagnostic devices for which clinical trials should be reported according to Standards for the Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) criteria. [17]

A 30-item checklist is provided to account for essential
aspects that need to be reported in diagnostic studies. In
addition, a standardized flow diagram gives a full overview
on the study.
Reporting studies according to the STARD criteria
increases the quality of the reports and helps readers identify the level of evidence the study provides. Table 2 helps
to adapt these general guidelines to the specific case of seizure detection. When the device specifically targets one
seizure type, this needs to be stated in the title and the
abstract. In the introduction, one should describe what the

pathophysiological basis of the seizure detection method is,
when this is possible. The Web address of the registry and
study protocol has to be specified, in accordance with the

STARD criteria.


6 | FACILITATING FUTURE
STUDIES ON SEIZURE DETECTION

DEVICES


An open, large database containing annotated signals
recorded with conventional methods and possibly also with
dedicated devices, from patients with epilepsy, including
both annotated seizure periods, and continuous, nonseizure
data, could facilitate development of new methods. This
could considerably decrease the time and costs of developing new seizure detection devices, because phase 0-2 studies could be completed using such databases. Therefore,
we would like to encourage the scientific community to
create such open databases. An example is EPILEPSIAE,
an extensive EEG database of epilepsy patients. [18]

Large research consortia, containing multidisciplinary
expertise, could facilitate rapid and efficient development
of seizure detection devices, and we would like to appeal
to the international research community to create such consortia. These should also include lay associations, because
the point of view of the patients is essential for designing
and developing useful seizure detection devices.
