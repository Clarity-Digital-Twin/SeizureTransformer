# Conclusion Section - Brainstorming Document

## Purpose of Conclusion
- Synthesize findings into actionable insights
- Reinforce the 27-137× gap narrative
- Call for systemic change in evaluation practices
- End on constructive, forward-looking note

## Key Messages to Reinforce

### 1. The Core Finding
- 27-137× gap between benchmark and clinical reality
- Not a model failure but evaluation ecosystem issue
- SeizureTransformer is good; evaluation standards are broken

### 2. The Scoring Impact
- 3.1× difference (NEDC OVERLAP vs SzCORE) from methodology alone
- 15.9× difference (NEDC TAES vs SzCORE) shows full spectrum
- Same predictions, vastly different "performance"

### 3. Clinical Reality Check
- Cannot meet FDA thresholds (≤10 FA/24h, ≥50% sensitivity)
- Best: 33.90% sensitivity at 10.27 FA/24h
- Deployment gap is real and quantifiable

### 4. Systemic Issues
- Models trained on datasets but evaluated elsewhere
- Benchmark gaming vs clinical needs
- Lack of standardized evaluation protocols

## Data Points to Emphasize

### Performance Metrics
- NEDC OVERLAP: 26.89 FA/24h (27× gap)
- NEDC TAES: 136.73 FA/24h (137× gap)
- SzCORE: 8.59 FA/24h (still 8.6× gap)
- Dianalund claim: ~1 FA/24h

### Evaluation Scale
- 865 files, 127.7 hours, 469 seizures
- Held-out, patient-disjoint test set
- No data leakage, proper evaluation

### Clinical Targets
- FDA standard: ≤10 FA/24h with ≥50% sensitivity
- Achieved: 33.90% @ 10.27 FA/24h (fails sensitivity)
- Gap between research and deployment

## Key Phrases to Include

### Opening Lines
- "Our evaluation reveals a 27-137× gap between SeizureTransformer's benchmark claims and clinical reality on TUSZ"
- "This work quantifies how scoring methodology alone creates multi-fold performance differences"

### Impact Statements
- "The 3.1× difference between NEDC OVERLAP and SzCORE demonstrates that evaluation choices determine deployment viability"
- "Models appearing clinically ready under permissive scoring fail standard thresholds with appropriate evaluation"

### Call to Action
- "Dataset-matched evaluation with transparent multi-scorer reporting must become standard practice"
- "Clinical AI requires clinical evaluation standards, not benchmark optimization"
- "The path forward requires transparent reporting, dataset-matched scoring, and honest assessment"

## What NOT to Include

### Avoid
- New technical details not in Results
- Overly critical language
- Personal attacks on authors
- Dismissal of any scoring method
- Defeatist tone about AI potential

### Don't Say
- "SeizureTransformer doesn't work"
- "EpilepsyBench is flawed"
- "NEDC is the only valid scorer"
- "The field is doomed"

## Tone Balance

### Professional Yet Direct
- Acknowledge genuine contributions
- Focus on systemic issues
- Provide constructive path forward
- Maintain scientific objectivity

### Examples
- ❌ "The field has been deceiving clinicians"
- ✅ "Evaluation practices have diverged from clinical needs"
- ❌ "Models are failing badly"
- ✅ "Current evaluation standards prevent accurate assessment"

## Connections to Earlier Sections

### From Abstract
- "Dataset-matched, clinician-aligned evaluation is essential"
- Reinforce this as core message

### From Introduction
- "Critical evaluation gap exists"
- Show we've filled this gap

### From Results
- 26.89 FA/24h (NEDC OVERLAP)
- 33.90% @ 10.27 FA/24h best operating point
- Use exact numbers

### From Discussion
- "Systemic issues in evaluation"
- "Need for standardized protocols"
- Echo but don't repeat verbatim

## Specific Recommendations to Include

### For Researchers
1. Always evaluate on training dataset's held-out set
2. Report multiple scoring methodologies
3. Provide complete operating curves
4. Use dataset-matched evaluation tools

### For Community
1. Establish minimum reporting standards
2. Create evaluation checklists
3. Require transparency about scoring choices
4. Develop clinical validation protocols

### For Clinicians
1. Demand dataset-matched evaluation
2. Request specific operating points
3. Understand scoring methodology impact
4. Require real-world validation data

## Powerful Closing Options

### Option A: Forward-Looking
"As seizure detection models approach clinical deployment, the field stands at a crossroads: continue optimizing for benchmarks that may mislead, or establish rigorous evaluation standards that bridge the gap between laboratory success and patient benefit."

### Option B: Call to Action
"The 27-137× gap we document is not insurmountable but requires fundamental changes in how we evaluate seizure detection models. Transparent, dataset-matched, multi-scorer evaluation can transform benchmark achievements into clinical reality."

### Option C: Balanced Summary
"SeizureTransformer's architectural innovations remain valuable contributions, but our evaluation reveals that meaningful clinical deployment requires more than algorithmic advances—it demands evaluation standards that reflect clinical reality rather than optimize benchmark metrics."

## The Final Message

SeizureTransformer succeeds as an architecture but reveals failures in evaluation. The path from benchmark to bedside requires:
1. Dataset-matched scoring (TUSZ→NEDC)
2. Multi-scorer transparency
3. Clinical operating points
4. Honest gap assessment

The 27-137× gap is not the end but the beginning of honest evaluation that can ultimately deliver on the promise of AI-assisted seizure detection.
