## Verification Results

### Search Verification ✅
```bash
# No remaining "Native OVERLAP" in main text (only in validation notes)
grep -n "Native OVERLAP" CURRENT_WORKING_DRAFT_ASSEMBLED.md
# Returns: 0 results in main text

# Confirmed "three scoring" throughout
grep -n "three scoring" CURRENT_WORKING_DRAFT_ASSEMBLED.md
# Returns: 4 occurrences (Abstract, Intro, Methods, Results)

# No "four scoring" remaining
grep -n "four scoring" CURRENT_WORKING_DRAFT_ASSEMBLED.md
# Returns: 0 results
```

### Assembly Verification ✅
- `bash assemble.sh` executed successfully
- CURRENT_WORKING_DRAFT_ASSEMBLED.md generated
- All sections properly concatenated

## Numbers Preserved ✅

All performance metrics remain unchanged:

**Default (θ=0.80)**
- NEDC TAES: 65.21% / 136.73 FA/24h
- NEDC OVERLAP: 45.63% / 26.89 FA/24h
- SzCORE Event: 52.35% / 8.59 FA/24h

**10 FA/24h Target (θ=0.88)**
- NEDC TAES: 60.45% / 83.88 FA/24h
- NEDC OVERLAP: 33.90% / 10.27 FA/24h
- SzCORE Event: 40.59% / 3.36 FA/24h

**2.5 FA/24h Target (θ=0.95)**
- NEDC TAES: 18.12% / 10.64 FA/24h
- NEDC OVERLAP: 14.50% / 2.05 FA/24h
- SzCORE Event: 19.71% / 0.75 FA/24h

**~1 FA/24h (θ=0.98)**
- NEDC OVERLAP: 8.10% / 0.86 FA/24h
- vs Dianalund: 37% / 1 FA/24h (4.6× drop)

## Key Messages Preserved ✅

1. **27-137× performance gap** - ✅ Unchanged
2. **8.6× cross-dataset degradation** - ✅ Enhanced with new section
3. **15.9× spread from scoring** - ✅ Preserved
4. **Clinical viability failure** - ✅ Maintained

## Parity Documentation ✅

Methods section now includes:
> "We additionally implemented a native Python any-overlap scorer for validation and confirmed perfect parity with NEDC OVERLAP (identical metrics to four decimal places). To avoid redundancy, we report only the three primary scorers."

Appendix C.3 retitled and updated:
> "Implementation Validation" - explains parity validation without separate reporting

## CLI Updates ✅

All reproduction commands updated to use new CLIs:
- `tusz-eval` - Generate predictions
- `nedc-run` - NEDC evaluation
- `szcore-run` - SzCORE evaluation

## Summary

**All requested changes successfully implemented:**
- ✅ Native OVERLAP removed from all reporting tables
- ✅ Changed "four" to "three" scoring methodologies throughout
- ✅ Added parity validation notes where appropriate
- ✅ Updated CLI commands to new entry points
- ✅ Added cross-dataset validity section to Discussion
- ✅ Preserved all performance numbers exactly
- ✅ Maintained key messages and arguments

The paper now presents a cleaner narrative focused on three primary scorers (NEDC TAES, NEDC OVERLAP, SzCORE) while maintaining scientific rigor through validation notes.
