# Final Citation Verification Report

## ✅ Verification Status (final)

- All references cited in the manuscript are verified against converted source documents in `literature/markdown/*`.
- No phantom or uncited references remain in `09_references.md` (exactly 10 active citations).
- Clinical threshold language fixed: we no longer claim “≤10 FA/24h with ≥50% sensitivity.” We cite Roy et al. (2021) for the 75% sensitivity goal and human‑level ~1 FA/24h.

### Source‑backed items
- [1] Wu 2025 (SeizureTransformer) — arXiv entry validated
- [2] Shah, Golmohammadi, Obeid, Picone 2021 — Title and author list corrected to match source (“Objective Evaluation Metrics for Automatic Classification of EEG Events”)

- [7] Beniczky & Ryvlin 2018 — Title corrected to “devices”; DOI 10.1111/epi.14049

- [9] Gemein 2020 — EEG pathology generalization
- [10] Roy 2021 — 75% sensitivity clinical goal; ~1 FA/24h human‑level

### Notes
- “10 FA/24h” appears solely as an evaluation operating point we analyze, not as a clinical standard.
- All quantitative claims (AUROC 0.9019, 127.7 hours, merge_gap disabled) are internal results and process facts, not external citations.

Conclusion: The manuscript’s citations are reconciled with the converted sources; no uncertain references remain.
