### Additional Verified References

**[10] Beniczky & Ryvlin 2018** ✅ BUT WITH CAVEAT
- Verified from: `beniczky2018/beniczky2018.md`
- Title: "Standards for testing and clinical validation of seizure detection devices"
- **IMPORTANT**: Does NOT specify "10 FA/24h with ≥50% sensitivity" threshold
- Only defines phases of validation and metrics to report
- We now correctly cite this for standardized evaluation metrics only

**[11] Haibe-Kains et al. 2020** ✅
- Verified from: `HAIBE-KAINS/HAIBE-KAINS.md`
- Nature 2020;586(7829):E14-E16
- Correct title and author list
- Supports reproducibility crisis argument

**[12] Kelly et al. 2019** ✅
- Verified from: `kelly-et-al/kelly-et-al.md`
- BMC Medicine 2019;17(1):195
- All 5 authors correct
- Supports deployment challenges discussion

**[16] Roy et al. 2021** ✅ NEW ADDITION
- Verified from: `roy-et-al-2021/Evaluation of artificial intelligence systems.md`
- eBioMedicine 2021;66:103275
- **KEY CITATION**: Establishes 75% sensitivity as clinical goal
- States human-level performance is 1 FA/24h
- Now correctly cited for clinical thresholds

## ⚠️ REFERENCES STILL TO VERIFY

The following references have NOT been verified against source PDFs:

**[7] Obeid & Picone 2016** ❓
- Temple EEG Corpus paper
- Need to verify exact title and journal

**[8] Goldberger 2000** ❓
- PhysioNet paper
- Circulation journal citation needs verification

**[9] Shoeb 2009** ❓
- MIT PhD thesis on CHB-MIT dataset
- Need to verify thesis title

**[13] Shoeibi et al. 2021** ❓
- Review paper on deep learning for seizure detection
- Int J Environ Res Public Health - needs verification

**[14] Gemein et al. 2020** ❓
- NeuroImage paper on EEG pathology
- Machine learning diagnostics paper

**[15] Roy Y et al. 2019** ❓
- J Neural Eng systematic review
- Different Roy than Roy S (2021)

## PDFs Still to Analyze

Looking at the pdfs folder:
1. ✅ `beniczky2018.pdf` - CONVERTED & VERIFIED
2. ✅ `Evaluation of artificial intelligence systems.pdf` - CONVERTED & VERIFIED (Roy 2021)
3. ✅ `HAIBE-KAINS.pdf` - CONVERTED & VERIFIED
4. ✅ `kelly-et-al.pdf` - CONVERTED & VERIFIED
5. ❓ `seizure_preprocessing.pdf` - NOT YET CONVERTED
6. ✅ `SEIZURE_TRANSFORMER.pdf` - CONVERTED & VERIFIED
7. ✅ `SzCORE.pdf` - CONVERTED & VERIFIED

## Critical Fix Applied

### BEFORE (INCORRECT):
- Claimed "≤10 FA/24h with ≥50% sensitivity" as THE clinical standard
- Cited Beniczky 2018 for this threshold
- This was WRONG - Beniczky doesn't say this

### AFTER (CORRECT):
- Now cite Roy et al. 2021 for 75% sensitivity clinical goal
- Now cite Roy et al. 2021 for 1 FA/24h human-level performance
- Present 10 FA/24h as OUR evaluation threshold (not a standard)
- Correctly note our 33.90% sensitivity falls far short of 75% goal

## Summary

- **10 of 16 references** fully verified ✅
- **6 references** not yet verified (but only 1 is cited in main text: Gemein 2020) ❓
- **1 PDF** (`seizure_preprocessing.pdf`) not converted (not cited in paper)
- **Critical citation error FIXED**: Now using Roy 2021 for clinical thresholds instead of incorrectly citing Beniczky 2018

## Action Items

1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Fixed incorrect "10 FA/24h with ≥50% sensitivity" claims
2. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Added Roy et al. 2021 for correct clinical thresholds (75% sensitivity, 1 FA/24h)
3. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Updated all paper sections with correct citations
4. ⚠️ **CONSIDER**: Remove uncited references [7], [8], [9], [13], [15] if not actually used
5. ⚠️ **VERIFY**: Gemein 2020 [14] - only unverified reference actually cited in text
