# Acknowledgments

We thank Joseph Picone and the Neural Engineering Data Consortium at Temple University for creating and maintaining the TUSZ dataset and NEDC evaluation tools, which enabled this rigorous assessment. We are grateful to Kerui Wu and colleagues for making their SeizureTransformer model weights publicly available, demonstrating exemplary commitment to reproducible research. We acknowledge the EpilepsyBench initiative for advancing standardized benchmarking in seizure detection, even as our work highlights areas for improvement. Special thanks to the clinical EEG experts whose annotations in TUSZ made dataset-matched evaluation possible. This work used computational resources provided by [Institution] and was partially supported by [Grant details if applicable]. The authors declare no competing interests.
