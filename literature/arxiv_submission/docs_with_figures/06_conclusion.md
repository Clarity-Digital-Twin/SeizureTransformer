# Conclusion

Our evaluation of SeizureTransformer on TUSZ's held-out test set reveals a 27–137× gap between benchmark claims and clinical reality, with the model producing 26.89 false alarms per 24 hours using NEDC OVERLAP versus the ~1 FA/24h achieved on Dianalund. This discrepancy stems not from model failure but from fundamental mismatches in evaluation methodology. The same predictions yield 8.59 FA/24h with SzCORE's permissive tolerances, 26.89 FA/24h with NEDC OVERLAP, and 136.73 FA/24h with NEDC TAES—a nearly 16-fold spread determined entirely by scoring philosophy. When optimized for a 10 FA/24h threshold with NEDC scoring, the model achieves only 33.90% sensitivity, falling far short of the 75% sensitivity goal for clinical systems (Roy et al., 2021). These findings demonstrate that meaningful progress in automated seizure detection requires evaluation standards that match clinical reality rather than optimize benchmark metrics.

The path forward demands fundamental changes in how the field approaches evaluation. Models must be evaluated on held-out portions of their training datasets using dataset-matched scoring tools—TUSZ with NEDC, CHB-MIT with their protocols, and private datasets with their clinical standards. Papers should report performance across multiple scoring methodologies, acknowledging that different clinical applications require different evaluation approaches while maintaining transparency about which methods are used. Complete operating curves showing the sensitivity-false alarm tradeoff space enable clinicians to select thresholds appropriate for their specific use cases. Most critically, the community must establish minimum reporting standards that include dataset version, evaluation tool version, and complete post-processing parameters to ensure reproducibility. As seizure detection models approach deployment readiness, the field stands at a crossroads: continue optimizing for benchmarks that may mislead, or establish rigorous evaluation standards that bridge the gap between laboratory success and patient benefit. The 27-137× gap we document is not insurmountable but requires the collective will to prioritize clinical validity over benchmark performance.
