## ⚠️ CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

### Figure 3 - NOW USES REAL DATA ✅
- Was using synthetic np.random data (would be academic misconduct!)
- Now uses actual parameter sweep from `parameter_sweep_heatmap.csv`
- MD5: `56968997640265cca38aa15b42fa18f0`

### All Issues Fixed:
✅ NEDC correctly named as "Neural Engineering Data Consortium"
✅ Roy et al. 2021 [13] added for 75% sensitivity/1 FA per 24h claims
✅ F1 score corrected to 0.414
✅ All PDFs regenerated with real data
