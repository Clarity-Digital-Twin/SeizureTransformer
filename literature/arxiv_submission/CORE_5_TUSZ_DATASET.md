# CORE 5: TUSZ Dataset and Evaluation Splits
## The Gold Standard Dataset with Overlooked Evaluation Potential

### Executive Summary
TUSZ v2.0.3 is the largest public seizure dataset with carefully designed patient-disjoint splits. Despite having a true held-out evaluation set, models trained on TUSZ are rarely evaluated on it with proper clinical scoring. This represents a massive missed opportunity for valid performance assessment.

## The Three-Way Split Design

### Official Splits (v2.0.3)

| Split | Files | Hours | Patients | Seizures | Purpose |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Train** | 4,667 | 910.3 | 579 | 2,420 | Model training |
| **Dev** | 1,832 | 435.5 | 53 | 1,075 | Hyperparameter tuning |
| **Eval** | 865 | 127.7 | 43 | 469 | **Held-out testing** |

**Source**: `/data/tusz/AAREADME.txt` lines 157-227 (file counts, seizure counts)
**Hours calculated**: lines 230-236 (duration in seconds / 3600)

### Critical Design Feature
```
PATIENT-DISJOINT SPLITS
- No patient appears in multiple splits
- Prevents data leakage
- Enables valid generalization testing
```

### Why This Matters
**The eval set is truly held-out and valid for assessment**

---

## The Annotation Philosophy

### Temple's Guidelines (from documentation)

1. **Conservative Labeling**
   - Clear electrographic seizures only
   - Minimum 10-second duration
   - Definite evolution required

2. **Temporal Precision**
   - Onset marked at first clear change
   - Offset at return to baseline
   - No pre/post-ictal extensions

3. **Multi-Reviewer Process**
   - Initial annotation
   - Expert review
   - Consensus for ambiguous cases

### Connection to NEDC
These annotation principles directly inform NEDC's scoring design - they're matched pairs.

## The EpilepsyBench 🚂 Situation

### What Happens
```
SeizureTransformer Training:
- TUSZ v1.5.2 train subset (~910 hours)
- Siena dataset (128 hours)
- Total: ~1,038 hours

**Source**: Wu et al. 2025 paper, Section 3.1

EpilepsyBench Display:
- TUSZ: 🚂 (no metrics shown)
- Message: "Model trained on this dataset"
```

### The Missed Opportunity

#### What Could Be Done
```
Available: TUSZ eval set (865 files, patient-disjoint)
Status: Never tested by model authors
Result: No one knows true TUSZ performance
```

#### Our Contribution
**We perform this missing evaluation, revealing 100.06 FA/24h**

**Source**: `/docs/results/FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_RESULTS_TABLE.md` line 36
**Location**: `/experiments/eval/baseline/CLEAN_NO_MERGE/DEFAULT/`

### Professional Interpretation
While EpilepsyBench's caution about training data is understandable, it overlooks the careful split design that enables valid held-out evaluation.

## Why TUSZ + NEDC is Special

### The Matched Ecosystem

```
   TUSZ Dataset          NEDC Scorer
        ↓                     ↓
  Annotations            Evaluation
  Philosophy            Philosophy
        ↓                     ↓
   Temporal              No tolerance
   Precision              windows
        ↓                     ↓
      Designed to Work Together
```

### Contrast with SzCORE
```
SzCORE: Generic scorer for any dataset
- Adds 30s/60s tolerances
- Not matched to TUSZ philosophy
- Results in 12× FA reduction
```

## How to Write About TUSZ

### DO Say
- "Largest public seizure dataset with clinical annotations"
- "Carefully designed patient-disjoint splits"
- "Eval set enables valid held-out testing"

### DON'T Say
- "TUSZ is perfect" (has limitations)
- "Only dataset that matters" (others valuable too)
- "Train/eval contamination" (properly split)

### Cutting but Fair Language
- "Despite patient-disjoint eval set, never properly evaluated"
- "The 🚂 marking obscures valid testing opportunity"
- "Models claim TUSZ training but avoid TUSZ evaluation"

---

## The Training Data Question

### What SeizureTransformer Used
```
Training:
- TUSZ v1.5.2 subset (~910 hours)
- Not full TUSZ train set
- Plus Siena data (128 hours)

Our Evaluation:
- TUSZ v2.0.3 eval (127.6 hours)
- Completely unseen during training
- Patient-disjoint from train
```

### Version Compatibility
- v1.5.2 → v2.0.3: Annotation refinements
- Core data largely unchanged
- Split structure maintained

## Critical Insights for Paper

### The Evaluation Gap
1. **Train on TUSZ**: ✅ (everyone does)
2. **Tune on TUSZ dev**: ✅ (standard practice)
3. **Test on TUSZ eval**: ❌ (no one does)
4. **Test with NEDC**: ❌ (never done before us)

### The Performance Reality
```
Expected (from benchmarks): ~10 FA/24h
Reality (with NEDC): 100.06 FA/24h
Gap: 10× higher than expected
```

### The Broader Pattern
- Train on dataset X
- Evaluate on dataset Y
- Claim generalization
- **Never test on X's eval set**

---

## Recommendations

### For Dataset Creators
1. Emphasize eval set availability
2. Provide matched scoring tools
3. Track who actually evaluates

### For Model Developers
1. Always test on training dataset's eval
2. Use dataset-matched scorers
3. Report multiple metrics

### For Benchmarks
1. Show eval results even for training datasets
2. Distinguish train/eval contamination from valid splits
3. Encourage proper evaluation

2. The eval set exists for a reason
3. Not using it is missing opportunity

### Why This Matters

- Clinical deployment needs honest metrics
- Patients deserve accurate performance claims

### Our Contribution
We simply did what should have been done: properly evaluated on the held-out test set with the clinical standard scorer.
