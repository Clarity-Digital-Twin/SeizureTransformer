# Introduction

This section presents the motivation, problem framing, and our contributions.

Use SSOT: `core_documents/CORE_SYNTHESIS.md`, `CONTRIBUTIONS_AND_NOVELTY.md`.

- Problem: Benchmark claims vs clinical reality (100Ã— gap context)
- Setup: TUSZ (CORE 5) + NEDC (CORE 4) as matched clinical standard
- Divergence: SzCORE/EpilepsyBench (CORE 3) vs NEDC (CORE 1)
- Contribution (concise bullets; no fluff): first NEDC v6.0.0 eval on TUSZ; multi-scorer comparison; reproducible pipeline
- One-paragraph roadmap of paper
