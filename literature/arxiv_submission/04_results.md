Purpose: present key numbers clearly and concisely.

Use SSOT: `core_documents/CORE_SYNTHESIS.md`, `core_documents/FIGURES_PLAN.md`, `docs/results/FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_RESULTS_TABLE.md` (for source values).

- Default params: report sensitivity and FA/24h for all four scoring methods
- Operating points: 10 FA/24h target, 2.5 FA/24h target — what is achievable
- Scoring impact: ≈12× difference (OVERLAP vs SzCORE); ≈16× TAES vs SzCORE
- NEDC/Python parity: identical numbers for OVERLAP
- Figures: references to Fig. 1 (performance spectrum), Fig. 3 (clinical zones)
