# Deep Audit Report: ArXiv Submission Verification
## Date: September 18, 2025

## Executive Summary
After conducting a thorough audit of the external agent's findings against the actual codebase, I've identified several **CRITICAL ISSUES** that must be addressed before ArXiv submission, as well as corrections to the external agent's analysis.

## CRITICAL ISSUES CONFIRMED ⚠️

### 1. **SYNTHETIC FIGURE 3 - ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL**
**Finding:** CONFIRMED - Figure 3 (parameter heatmap) is completely synthetic!
- **Location:** `literature/arxiv_submission/figures/scripts/fig3_parameter_heatmap.py:52-67`
- **Evidence:** The script generates F1 scores using `np.random.seed(kernel)` and arbitrary formulas
- **Impact:** This is academic misconduct if presented as real results
- **Required Action:** MUST generate real parameter sweep data and replace synthetic figure

### 2. **NEDC Naming Error**
**Finding:** CONFIRMED - NEDC is incorrectly expanded in FINAL_PAPER_CLEAN.md
- **Locations:**
  - Line 35: "Neural Event Detection Competition" ❌
  - Line 51: "Neural Event Detection Competition" ❌
- **Correct:** "Neural Engineering Data Consortium" ✓
- **Required Action:** Fix both occurrences in FINAL_PAPER_CLEAN.md

### 3. **F1 Score Inconsistency**
**Finding:** CONFIRMED - F1 values don't match between data files
- **Evidence:**
  - `operating_curves.csv:4`: NEDC OVERLAP F1 = 0.414
  - `key_results_summary.csv:3`: NEDC OVERLAP F1 = 0.396 (WRONG)
- **Required Action:** Update key_results_summary.csv to use F1 = 0.414

### 4. **Citation Error**
**Finding:** CONFIRMED - Wrong citation for human baseline claims
- **Locations:** Lines 23, 43, 156, 198, 226 cite [6] (Beniczky 2018)
- **Issue:** Should these cite Roy 2021 [13] instead? Need to verify the actual source
- **Required Action:** Verify correct citation and update if needed

### 5. **Missing CLI Commands**
**Finding:** CONFIRMED - Referenced commands don't exist
- **Missing:** `tusz-eval`, `nedc-run`, `szcore-run`
- **Status:** TECHNICAL DEBT - Will be implemented post-submission
- **Note:** These are wrapper scripts for existing functionality that works
- **Required Action:** None for ArXiv submission - mark as future implementation

## ISSUES CORRECTED FROM EXTERNAL AUDIT

### 1. **docs/results Directory**
**External Agent Claim:** "docs/results/* path does not exist"
**Reality:** Directory EXISTS at `/mnt/c/Users/JJ/Desktop/Clarity-Digital-Twin/SeizureTransformer/docs/results/`
- Contains: BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md, FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_RESULTS_TABLE.md, etc.
- **No action needed**

### 2. **Date Issues**
**External Agent Confusion:** Worried about "2025 dates"
**Reality:** Today IS September 18, 2025 - dates are correct
- **No action needed**

### 3. **AUROC Values**
**External Agent Claim:** "0.9019 vs 0.876 discrepancy"
**Reality:** Paper consistently uses 0.9019
- Data file confirms: `key_results_summary.csv:13` → AUROC = 0.9019
- Paper text matches: Line 172 → "AUROC of 0.9019"
- **No action needed**

## Source of Truth for Data

### Performance Metrics (Verified)
**Primary Source:** `literature/arxiv_submission/figures/data/operating_curves.csv`
- NEDC OVERLAP @ 0.80: 26.89 FA/24h, 45.63% sensitivity, F1 = 0.414 ✓
- NEDC TAES @ 0.80: 136.73 FA/24h, 65.21% sensitivity ✓
- SzCORE Event @ 0.80: 8.59 FA/24h, 52.35% sensitivity ✓

### Dataset Statistics (Verified)
- 865 files, 127.7 hours, 469 seizures, 43 patients ✓
- Consistent across all documents

## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Priority 1 - MUST FIX BEFORE SUBMISSION
1. **Replace synthetic Figure 3:**
   - Run actual parameter sweep
   - Save results to `parameter_sweep_heatmap.csv`
   - Update `fig3_parameter_heatmap.py` to use real data

2. **Fix NEDC naming in FINAL_PAPER_CLEAN.md:**
   ```bash
   # Lines 35 and 51: Change "Neural Event Detection Competition"
   # to "Neural Engineering Data Consortium"
   ```

3. **Fix F1 score in key_results_summary.csv:**
   ```bash
   # Line 3: Change F1 from 0.396 to 0.414
   ```

### Priority 2 - Should Fix
1. Verify and correct citation [6] vs [13] for human baseline claims

### Priority 3 - Nice to Have
1. Add note explaining AUROC on different eval sets if relevant
2. Ensure consistent decimal precision (0.902 vs 0.9019)

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check for synthetic code
grep -n "np.random" literature/arxiv_submission/figures/scripts/*.py

# Verify NEDC naming
grep "Neural Event Detection Competition" literature/arxiv_submission/FINAL_PAPER_CLEAN.md

# Check F1 consistency
grep "0.414\|0.396" literature/arxiv_submission/figures/data/*.csv
```

## Conclusion

The external agent found several **CRITICAL ISSUES** that are confirmed:
1. Synthetic Figure 3 - MUST be replaced with real data
2. NEDC naming errors - easy fix but important
3. F1 score inconsistency - needs alignment
4. Missing reproducibility commands

However, the agent was wrong about:
- docs/results directory (it exists)
- Date issues (2025 is correct)
- AUROC discrepancies (no issue found)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Do NOT submit to ArXiv until at minimum the Priority 1 issues are resolved, especially the synthetic figure which could be considered academic misconduct.
