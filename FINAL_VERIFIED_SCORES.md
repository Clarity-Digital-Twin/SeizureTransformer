## 1Ô∏è‚É£ DEFAULT CONFIGURATION
**Parameters**: threshold=0.8, kernel=5, min_duration=2.0s, merge_gap=0.0s

| Scoring Method | Sensitivity (%) | FA/24h | Notes |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| **NEDC Binary TAES** | 24.15% | 27.13 | Temple's strictest scorer |
| **NEDC Binary OVERLAP** | 45.63% | 26.71 | Temple's overlap scorer |
| **Native Python OVERLAP** | 45.63% | 100.06 | ‚ö†Ô∏è FA discrepancy vs NEDC |
| **SzCORE (Any-Overlap)** | 52.35% | 8.46 | EpilepsyBench scorer |

**Assessment**: Native Python shows 4x higher FA than NEDC Binary (bug?)

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ 10 FA/24h TARGET
**Parameters**: threshold=0.95, kernel=5, min_duration=2.0s, merge_gap=5.0s

| Scoring Method | Sensitivity (%) | FA/24h | Status |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| **NEDC Binary TAES** | 9.08% | 2.83 | ‚úÖ Exceeds target |
| **NEDC Binary OVERLAP** | 23.45% | 2.82 | ‚úÖ Exceeds target |
| **Native Python OVERLAP** | 23.45% | 9.97 | ‚úÖ Meets target |
| **SzCORE (Any-Overlap)** | 29.12% | 1.32 | ‚úÖ Near 1 FA! |

**Achievement**: ALL methods meet 10 FA target!

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ 2.5 FA/24h TARGET
**Parameters**: threshold=0.95, kernel=11, min_duration=8.0s, merge_gap=10.0s

| Scoring Method | Sensitivity (%) | FA/24h | Status |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| **NEDC Binary TAES** | 4.13% | 1.32 | ‚úÖ Exceeds target |
| **NEDC Binary OVERLAP** | 11.51% | 1.32 | ‚úÖ Exceeds target |
| **Native Python OVERLAP** | 11.51% | 2.44 | ‚úÖ Meets target |
| **SzCORE (Any-Overlap)** | 16.47% | 0.56 | ‚úÖ <1 FA achieved! |

**Achievement**: ALL methods meet 2.5 FA target! SzCORE achieves <1 FA!

---

## üìä KEY FINDINGS

1. **NEDC Binary is BEST**: Achieves lowest FA rates consistently
2. **Native Python has FA inflation**: Shows ~3-4x higher FA than NEDC Binary
3. **SzCORE is most lenient**: Best sensitivity/FA trade-off
4. **With proper tuning**: We CAN achieve clinical FA targets!

### Best Results by Target:
- **Clinical (10 FA)**: NEDC Binary @ 23.45% sens, 2.82 FA
- **ICU (2.5 FA)**: SzCORE @ 16.47% sens, 0.56 FA
- **Long-term (1 FA)**: SzCORE @ 16.47% sens, 0.56 FA ‚úÖ

## üéØ RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATIONS

**For NEDC scoring (clinical standard):**
```python
# 10 FA target
config = {'threshold': 0.95, 'kernel': 5, 'min_duration': 2.0, 'merge_gap': 5.0}
# Achieves: 23.45% @ 2.82 FA/24h

# 2.5 FA target  
config = {'threshold': 0.95, 'kernel': 11, 'min_duration': 8.0, 'merge_gap': 10.0}
# Achieves: 11.51% @ 1.32 FA/24h
```

**For SzCORE scoring (EpilepsyBench):**
```python
# 1 FA target
config = {'threshold': 0.95, 'kernel': 11, 'min_duration': 8.0}
# Achieves: 16.47% @ 0.56 FA/24h
```
