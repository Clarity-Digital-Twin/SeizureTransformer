# FINAL COMPREHENSIVE RESULTS TABLE - NO MERGE GAP
**All results WITHOUT merge_gap parameter (honest, real numbers)**

## Understanding the Scoring Methods

Each scoring method serves different purposes in seizure detection evaluation:

1. **NEDC Temple TAES** - Most strict (Time-Aligned Event Scoring)
   - Proposed by Picone et al. (2021) as improved metric
   - Weights detections by percentage of overlap
   - Provides most rigorous temporal accuracy assessment

2. **NEDC Temple OVERLAP** - Common practice (Any-overlap scoring)
   - Widely used in TUSZ evaluations
   - Any temporal overlap counts as detection
   - **Our tuning target** - balanced for practical use

3. **Python OVERLAP** - Our implementation
   - Validates parity with Temple's NEDC binary
   - Identical results to NEDC OVERLAP

4. **SzCORE** - EpilepsyBench standard (most permissive)
   - Includes 30s pre-ictal and 60s post-ictal tolerances
   - Merges events <90s apart
   - Designed for clinical applications where early warning is valuable

## KEY FINDINGS

### Performance Under Different Standards
- **NEDC Standard (widely used):** Cannot meet clinical FA targets
  - 10 FA/24h target: Achieves 39.50 FA @ 23.45% sensitivity
  - 2.5 FA/24h target: Achieves 8.09 FA @ 11.51% sensitivity
  - 1 FA/24h target: Would require <5% sensitivity (clinically unusable)

- **SzCORE Standard (EpilepsyBench):** Meets all targets
  - Different evaluation philosophy with pre/post-ictal tolerances
  - ~10x more permissive due to event merging and tolerances
  - Designed for practical clinical applications

### Important Context
- Different scoring methods serve different clinical and research needs
- SzCORE's permissiveness reflects real-world clinical priorities (early warning)
- NEDC's stricter scoring reflects research priorities (temporal precision)
- **Neither approach is "wrong" - they measure different aspects of performance**

Note on FA/24h: For NEDC and Python OVERLAP rows, FA/24h refers to Temple’s "Total False Alarm Rate"
(SEIZ + BCKG) as reported by the NEDC v6.0.0 summaries. SzCORE FA/24h follows its event-based definition.

### Methodology Note
We tuned parameters using NEDC OVERLAP (the common practice for TUSZ) and evaluated across all metrics for transparency. This reveals how scoring methodology significantly impacts reported performance.
