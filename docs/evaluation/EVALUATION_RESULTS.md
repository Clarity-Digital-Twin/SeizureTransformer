# SeizureTransformer Clinical Evaluation Results

**Date**: September 12, 2025  
**Dataset**: Temple University Hospital EEG Seizure Corpus (TUSZ) v2.0.0  
**Evaluator**: NEDC EEG Eval v6.0.0 (Official Temple University Scoring)

## Executive Summary

We successfully evaluated the SeizureTransformer model on 864 EEG recordings from the TUSZ evaluation set, achieving an **AUROC of 0.9021**, surpassing the paper's reported 0.876. However, official NEDC scoring reveals significant challenges in clinical deployment due to high false alarm rates.

## Key Findings

### 1. Model Performance Metrics

#### AUROC (Area Under ROC Curve)
- **Our Result**: 0.9021 âœ…
- **Paper Claim**: 0.876
- **Improvement**: +2.6%

The model demonstrates excellent discrimination ability between seizure and non-seizure patterns at the sample level.

#### NEDC TAES (Time-Aligned Event Scoring) - Gold Standard
- **Sensitivity**: 24.15% (113.28/469 seizure events detected)
- **Specificity**: 88.03%
- **Precision**: 43.98%
- **F1 Score**: 0.312
- **False Alarm Rate**: 137.5 per 24 hours

#### Clinical Impact Analysis
- **False alarms every**: 10.5 minutes
- **Daily false alarms**: 138
- **Weekly false alarms**: 962

This frequency would create significant alarm fatigue in ICU settings.

### 2. Performance Across Scoring Methods

| Metric | TAES | Overlap | Epoch |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| Sensitivity | 24.15% | 45.63% | 26.46% |
| Specificity | 88.03% | 90.36% | 99.71% |
| F1 Score | 0.312 | 0.519 | 0.404 |
| FA/24hr | 137.5 | 100.1 | 238.9 |

### 3. Dataset Statistics

- **Total EEG files**: 864 (1 excluded due to format error)
- **Total duration**: 459,394 seconds (127.6 hours)
- **Total samples analyzed**: 117,604,918
- **Seizure prevalence**: 5.93% of samples
- **Total seizure events**: 469
- **Total background events**: 1,333

## Technical Implementation Details

### Model Configuration
- **Architecture**: Transformer-based (from Wu et al. 2025)
- **Input**: 19-channel unipolar EEG at 256 Hz
- **Window size**: 60 seconds (15,360 samples)
- **Preprocessing**: Z-score normalization, bandpass 0.5-120 Hz, notch at 60 Hz

### Post-processing Parameters
- **Probability threshold**: 0.8
- **Morphological kernel**: 5 samples
- **Minimum event duration**: 2.0 seconds
- **All events < 2s removed**

### Computational Resources
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 4090 (24GB)
- **Processing time**: ~30 minutes for 864 files
- **Average speed**: 1.92 seconds per 30-minute EEG file

## Critical Observations

### Strengths
1. **High AUROC (0.902)**: Excellent discrimination capability
2. **High specificity (88-99%)**: Low false positives in non-seizure patients
3. **Fast inference**: Real-time capable on modern GPUs

### Limitations
1. **Low sensitivity (24%)**: Misses 76% of seizure events
2. **High false alarm rate**: 138 false alarms per day
3. **Poor temporal alignment**: TAES scoring shows weak event boundary detection

### Clinical Deployment Challenges

The current operating point (threshold=0.8) produces:
- A false alarm every 10.5 minutes
- Only 1 in 4 seizures detected
- Poor precision (44% of alarms are true seizures)

For ICU deployment, acceptable thresholds are typically:
- Sensitivity > 90% (missing seizures is dangerous)
- False alarms < 10 per 24 hours (prevent alarm fatigue)

**Current performance gap**: 14x too many false alarms, 3.7x too low sensitivity

## Reproducibility

All code, configurations, and results are available in this repository:
- Evaluation script: `evaluation/tusz/run_tusz_eval.py`
- NEDC pipeline: `evaluation/nedc_scoring/run_nedc.py`
- Checkpoint file: `evaluation/tusz/checkpoint.pkl` (470MB)
- NEDC results: `evaluation/nedc_scoring/output/results/`

### To Reproduce
```bash
# 1. Run TUSZ evaluation
python3 evaluation/tusz/run_tusz_eval.py

# 2. Convert to NEDC format
python3 evaluation/nedc_scoring/convert_predictions.py

# 3. Run NEDC scoring
export NEDC_NFC=$(pwd)/evaluation/nedc_eeg_eval/v6.0.0
export PYTHONPATH=$NEDC_NFC/lib:$PYTHONPATH
python3 evaluation/nedc_scoring/run_nedc.py
```

## Critical Finding: Paper Discrepancy

**The paper's claim of "1 false positive per day" is from a different dataset (Dianalund) used in competition, NOT from TUSZ testing.** Table III in the paper shows TUSZ results but conspicuously omits false alarm rates. Our evaluation reveals:

- Paper's competition claim: 1 FA/day (Dianalund dataset, 4360 hours)
- Our TUSZ results: 137.5 FA/day (same TUSZ dataset as paper)
- **The paper never reported TUSZ false alarm rates** - likely because they're similarly high

This is a significant omission that misrepresents the model's real-world performance on the standard TUSZ benchmark.

## Conclusions

While SeizureTransformer achieves impressive AUROC scores, the NEDC evaluation reveals it is **not yet suitable for clinical deployment** due to:

1. **Alarm fatigue risk**: 138 false alarms daily would overwhelm clinical staff
2. **Missed seizures**: 76% of seizures go undetected
3. **Temporal imprecision**: Poor event boundary detection

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Threshold optimization**: Explore different operating points on the ROC curve
2. **Post-processing refinement**: Improve temporal smoothing and event merging
3. **Ensemble methods**: Combine with other detectors to reduce false alarms
4. **Domain adaptation**: Fine-tune on specific hospital's EEG patterns
5. **Clinical validation**: Test with different seizure types and patient populations

## Appendix: Metric Definitions

- **TAES (Time-Aligned Event Scoring)**: Strictest scoring requiring precise temporal alignment
- **Overlap Scoring**: Credits partial overlaps between predicted and true events  
- **Epoch Scoring**: Evaluates 1-second windows independently
- **AUROC**: Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (discrimination ability)
- **False Alarm Rate**: Number of false positive events per 24 hours of recording
