# Analysis Docs (Canonical)

This folder contains the current, canonical analysis documents. Older one-off debug write-ups and superseded analyses have been moved to `docs/archive/analysis/`.

Kept here (authoritative):
- PARAMETER_TUNING_ANALYSIS.md — current tuning findings and plan (no merge)
- PARITY_ACHIEVED_SUMMARY.md — exact parity with Temple OVERLAP
- SEIZURE_TRANSFORMER_DATAFLOW_TRACE.md — verified model/pipeline trace (with legacy-number disclaimer)

Archived:
- See `docs/archive/analysis/` for historical notes (kept for provenance).
