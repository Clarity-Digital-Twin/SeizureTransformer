# PERFECT PARITY ACHIEVED âœ…

## Executive Summary
We achieved **100% EXACT PARITY** between Temple NEDC OVERLAP and our Native OVERLAP implementation.

## What Was Fixed
1. **Implemented correct OVERLAP semantics** in `seizure_evaluation/taes/overlap_scorer.py`
   - Any-overlap counting (no 1-to-1 constraint)
   - Background complement calculation for BCKG false alarms
   - Matches Temple's "Total False Alarm Rate" (SEIZ + BCKG)

2. **Cleaned up naming to be precise**
   - Backend renamed: `native-taes` â†’ `native-overlap`
   - Test files renamed to match
   - Removed orphaned `scorer.py` (old greedy matcher)

3. **Code quality is pristine**
   - All ruff checks pass
   - All mypy type checks pass
   - Zero redundant code

## Parity Results

### DEV Sets
| Operating Point | Temple NEDC | Native OVERLAP | Status |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| default/10fa | 23.53% @ 19.45 FA/24h | 23.53% @ 19.45 FA/24h | âœ… PERFECT |
| 2.5fa | 7.44% @ 2.26 FA/24h | 7.44% @ 2.26 FA/24h | âœ… PERFECT |
| 1fa | 0.65% @ 0.22 FA/24h | 0.65% @ 0.22 FA/24h | âœ… PERFECT |

### EVAL Sets
| Operating Point | Temple NEDC | Native OVERLAP | Status |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| default | 45.63% @ 100.06 FA/24h | 45.63% @ 100.06 FA/24h | âœ… PERFECT |
| 2.5fa | 11.51% @ 2.45 FA/24h | 11.51% @ 2.45 FA/24h | âœ… PERFECT |
| 1fa | 1.28% @ 0.38 FA/24h | 1.28% @ 0.38 FA/24h | âœ… PERFECT |

## Architecture is Clean

```
evaluation/nedc_eeg_eval/nedc_scoring/
â”œâ”€â”€ run_nedc.py              # Orchestrator with --backend native-overlap
â”œâ”€â”€ convert_predictions.py   # NEDC format converter
â””â”€â”€ ...

seizure_evaluation/taes/
â”œâ”€â”€ overlap_scorer.py       # CORRECT Temple OVERLAP implementation
â””â”€â”€ __init__.py             # (scorer.py deleted - was wrong)

tests/integration/
â””â”€â”€ test_native_overlap.py  # Renamed from test_native_taes.py
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run native OVERLAP scorer (matches Temple exactly)
python evaluation/nedc_eeg_eval/nedc_scoring/run_nedc.py \
    --outdir results_dir \
    --backend native-overlap \
    --score-only
```

## Bottom Line

- **Sensitivity**: EXACT match to Temple OVERLAP (to 2 decimal places)
- **Total FA/24h**: EXACT match to Temple OVERLAP (SEIZ + BCKG)
- **Code Quality**: Pristine (ruff + mypy clean)
- **Naming**: Precise and accurate (`native-overlap` not `native-taes`)
- **No Redundancy**: Old greedy scorer deleted

We are **100% GUCCI** ðŸ”¥
