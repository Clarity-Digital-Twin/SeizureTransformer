## üìã Summary
- SeizureTransformer won EpilepsyBench 2025 with 1 FA/24h on Dianalund (using SzCORE's "Any-Overlap" scoring)
- Despite TUSZ having train/dev/eval splits, EpilepsyBench doesn't report eval results for models trained on it
- We evaluated it on TUSZ v2.0.3 using Temple's NEDC v6.0.0 - the clinical standard scorer for this dataset
- Result: 100.06 FA/24h at paper defaults (NEDC) vs 8.46 FA/24h (SzCORE), revealing a ‚âà12√ó scoring impact and ‚âà100√ó gap from Dianalund's 1 FA/24h

## üéØ Background

### SeizureTransformer Model
Wu et al.'s transformer-based seizure detector won the 2025 EpilepsyBench Challenge. The model achieved 37% sensitivity with 1 FA/24h on the Dianalund dataset, ranking #1 on the [SzCORE leaderboard](https://epilepsybenchmarks.com/benchmark/).

### The Gap in Current Evaluations
- EpilepsyBench uses SzCORE's simplified "Any-Overlap" scoring for all datasets, not dataset-specific clinical scorers
- TUSZ results for models trained on it are marked with üöÇ, despite patient-disjoint splits enabling valid held-out evaluation
- TUSZ paired with NEDC scoring represents the clinical gold standard
- No one had evaluated SeizureTransformer on TUSZ using Temple's official NEDC scorer
- See `docs/CORE3_EPILEPSYBENCH_SZCORE.md` for a professional, source-anchored writeup of EpilepsyBench vs. NEDC.

### Our Contribution
- First TUSZ v2.0.3 evaluation using NEDC v6.0.0 - Temple's official clinical scorer (2025)
- Reveals performance gap when using proper dataset-matched scoring vs generic SzCORE
- Systematic threshold tuning on dev set, validation on eval set
- Dual-track implementation: Temple binaries + production Python code
- Complete operating points for clinical deployment decisions

### Performance Comparison

| Dataset | Scoring Method | Sensitivity | False Alarms/24h | F1 Score |

| **TUSZ eval (2.5 FA target)** | SzCORE¬≥ | 16.47% | **0.56 FA/24h** ‚úÖ | - |

Note: Python OVERLAP matches NEDC OVERLAP at all operating points (omitted for brevity).

FA/24h reporting: For NEDC and Python OVERLAP rows, values are Temple‚Äôs Total False Alarm Rate (SEIZ + BCKG) from v6.0.0 summaries. SzCORE FA/24h follows its event-based definition.

¬π SzCORE: Event-based scoring with 30s pre-ictal, 60s post-ictal tolerances, merges events <90s apart (on Dianalund dataset)
¬≤ NEDC: Clinical standard scorer for TUSZ. TAES = strict time-alignment, OVERLAP = any-overlap within NEDC framework
¬≥ SzCORE: Same tolerances applied to TUSZ eval - note ~10x FA reduction vs NEDC due to event merging

**Critical Note**: These are different datasets AND different scoring methods. The 1 FA/24h was achieved on Dianalund (small Nordic dataset), not TUSZ. SzCORE includes 30s pre-ictal and 60s post-ictal tolerances plus event merging (<90s gaps), making it ~10x more permissive than NEDC. Both scoring approaches have merit - SzCORE prioritizes clinical early warning while NEDC prioritizes temporal precision.

### Understanding Scoring Differences

TUSZ annotations were created by Temple University following specific clinical guidelines, with NEDC scoring designed by the same team as the matched evaluator. When evaluated with SzCORE (which adds tolerances for early detection), the same predictions yield dramatically different FA rates (~10x lower). Neither approach is "wrong" - they measure different aspects:

- **NEDC**: Prioritizes temporal precision for research
- **SzCORE**: Prioritizes clinical utility with early warning tolerances

### Authoritative Results

- See [`docs/results/FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_RESULTS_TABLE.md`](docs/results/FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_RESULTS_TABLE.md) for the single source of truth: 4 scoring methods √ó 3 operating points (Default, 10 FA, 2.5 FA), all without merge_gap.
- See [`docs/evaluation/PARAMETER_TUNING_METHODOLOGY.md`](docs/evaluation/PARAMETER_TUNING_METHODOLOGY.md) for why we tuned on NEDC OVERLAP and how to interpret differences across scoring methods.

Note: Earlier drafts included merge_gap-based operating points. Those are deprecated and archived. All current numbers are computed with merge_gap disabled.

### Key Metrics (TUSZ v2.0.3 eval)
- **Primary scorer**: NEDC v6.0.0 (Temple's official metrics for TUSZ)
- **Comparison scorer**: SzCORE (EpilepsyBench standard with clinical tolerances)
- **Dataset**: TUSZ v2.0.3 eval split (865 files, 469 seizures)
- **Tuning methodology**: Parameters tuned on dev using NEDC OVERLAP
- **AUROC**: 0.9021 (excellent discrimination capacity)
- **Files processed**: 865/865 (one header repaired on a temporary copy via `pyedflib+repaired`)

## üîß Evaluation Framework

### Components
1. **Model Wrapper**: Integrated Wu's pretrained SeizureTransformer for TUSZ inference (no retraining - using authors' weights)
2. **NEDC Integration**: Temple's v6.0.0 binaries (unmodified) for official scoring
3. **Evaluation Pipeline**: Dev-set tuning ‚Üí Eval-set validation (only post-processing thresholds tuned)

### NEDC v6.0.0 Integration

| Implementation | Purpose | Location |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| Temple Binaries | Research validity | `evaluation/nedc_eeg_eval/v6.0.0/` |
| Native Python | Production deployment | `seizure_evaluation/` |

Both produce identical metrics (¬±0.1%). Temple's for papers, Python for deployment.

**Verify Parity:**
```bash
make -C evaluation/nedc_eeg_eval/nedc_scoring all BACKEND=temple
python tests/integration/test_nedc_conformance.py  # Confirms ¬±0.1% match
```

### Dataset and Methodology

| TUSZ Split | Files | Hours | Seizures | Our Use |
|------------|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| Train | 1,557 | 3,050 | ~2,900 | Not used (pretrained model) |
| Dev | 1,013 | 1,015 | ~920 | Threshold tuning |
| Eval (held-out) | 865 | 127.6 | 469 | Final results |

**Note**: Paper trains on TUSZ train subset (‚âà910h) + Siena (128h). We use the authors' pretrained weights; no retraining performed. Post-processing parameters were tuned on dev set using NEDC OVERLAP as target, then evaluated across all scoring methods for transparency.
