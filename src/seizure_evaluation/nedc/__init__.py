"""NEDC scoring wrapper package.

This package exposes a `nedc-run` entry point that defers to the vendored
NEDC orchestration tools under `evaluation/nedc_eeg_eval/nedc_scoring/`.

Note: This command expects to run from a repository checkout where the
`evaluation/` directory is present. It is not a standalone packaged scorer.
